Title: Visual Exploration of Study Abroad Locations

Adviser: Holly Rushmeier

The goal for my project was to make the initial exploration of study abroad programs for the academic year easier for Yale students. I wanted it to have a component that allows users to find where students with similar interests as them went abroad and also include a visual representation of these places. Thus, I created a chord graph that related students’ majors to the country they visited when studying abroad. In addition, I created a search function that displays photos from Flickr using the tag ‘studyabroad’ which allows the user to type a specific place in the search bar at the bottom of the page.

Before I decided to go abroad, I was overwhelmed by the amount of factors and possibilities I needed to think about. Starting the search for a program felt daunting and a commitment in itself. So, the main purpose of this project was to help students narrow down their search from the vast study abroad locations in a playful way. Therefore, when students visit the Yale’s study abroad website, they will be able to find more information about a specific study abroad program, facilitating the decision-making process and getting them excited to study abroad for a semester.

I hosted my website with Heroku. I used PostgreSQL to easily store and search my data since it was a component that Heroku provided. I used the D3 JavaScript library for my data visualization since they had functions I could use to more easily create a chord diagram. I coded in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.
